# Traffic Simulation – User Guide

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the **Traffic Simulation** tool. This application allows you to simulate, observe, and analyse traffic flows in real time. Users can manually add vehicles, control traffic signals, and perform stress tests to evaluate system behaviour under heavy traffic conditions.

## 2. Interface Overview

The screenshot below (Figure 1) illustrates the main application window.

**Figure 1: Traffic Simulation main window**
The central simulation area shows a four-way intersection with black roads on a green background. Traffic lights are visible at the intersection (red and green indicators). Vehicles appear on the roads once added. Surrounding panels provide statistics, filters, and controls.

The main window is divided into the following areas:

* **Simulation Area (Center)**
  Displays the road network, vehicles, and traffic lights in real time.

* **Statistics Panel (Top Left)**
  Shows current simulation statistics, such as the number of vehicles currently active in the simulation.

* **Filter Panel (Right Side)**
  Allows filtering by vehicle type and by street. The *Reset* button clears all active filters.

* **Control Panel (Bottom)**
  Contains all controls for running and managing the simulation.

### Control Panel Buttons

The control panel includes the following elements (as shown in Figure 1):

* Start
* Step
* Vehicle Type
* Add Car
* Stop
* Stress Test
* Signal
* Switch
* Export CSV
* Duration (s)
* Set Time

## 3. Basic Operation

### Start

Starts the SUMO-based traffic simulation.

### Step

Advances the simulation by one single time step. This is useful for step-by-step analysis.

### Vehicle Type

A dropdown menu used to select the type of vehicle to be added. Available options include:

* Blue
* Red
* Yellow
* White

### Add Car

Adds a new vehicle of the selected type to a random position on the map.

### Stop

Stops the SUMO simulation and pauses all vehicle movement.

### Stress Test

Automatically fills the map with 100 vehicles and advances the simulation continuously to test performance under heavy load.

### Signal

A dropdown menu used to select a specific intersection or traffic signal.

### Switch

Manually switches the selected traffic light between its available states.


### Settime

Manually sets the time for the duration of traffic light switching.
